### Introduction

High tech Christmas light displays involve the mapping and programming of thousands of addressable LEDs. This process is done by inputting the physical location in each light one by one into the programming software. This is an incredibly time consuming process. 

This project was started in 2021 as a collaborative effort to benefit the xLights open source community. We sought to create a program to map the physical locations of addressable LEDs in space from a video file. The previous method of programming addressable LEDs involved manually putting in the physical coordinates one by one into the programming software. This was a time consuming task. Our program seeks to make highly involved christmas lights displays easier to produce and less time consuming. 

### Technologies

Our program was written in C# with OpenCV (Emgu). The testing was done with NUnit. A webcam or phone can be used to record video. The output is a .xmodel file for use in the xLights program. 

### Other Applications of Image Processing

The core technologies in our program have uses beyond complex lights displays. Image processing has gained a huge role in the modern manufacturing. Mapping the physical location of wires and creating scale schematics is a broadly beneficial service. This project served a fun purpose while developing a broader set of valuable skills.
