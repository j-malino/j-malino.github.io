## Jolly Snowman

### Introduction

This project was started in 2021 as a collaborative effort to benefit the xLights open source community. We sought to create a program to map the physical locations of addressable LEDs in space from a video file. 
The previous method of programming addressable LEDs involved manually putting in the physical coordinates one by one into the programming software. This was a time consuming task. 
Our program seeks to make highly involved christmas lights displays easier to produce and less time consuming. 

### Technologies

Our program was written in C# with OpenCV (Emgu). The testing was done with NUnit. The program was designed to work on Windows 10.
