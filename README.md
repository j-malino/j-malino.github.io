## Welcome to my GitHub

Here you will find a personal repository of side projects. Sorry there aren't a lot right now! Most of my work from the research lab can't be hosted publicly. 

### About Me

When I'm not in the lab you can find me:
- Reading large textbooks on a treadmill in the Rec Center. Try not to judge, multitasking is my thing. 
- Creating games that let you know how badly you're doing.

### Professional Areas of Passion

Process Improvements
- As a lab manager process improvements have saved my lab countless hours and thousands of dollars. In grant funding that is a big deal!

Automating Small Tasks
- Have you explore all the add ons for the google suite of sheets and handouts?
