<h1 align="center">Hi <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MartinHeinz/MartinHeinz/master/wave.gif" width="30px">, I'm Jess</h1>
<h3 align="center">I'm a passionate researcher and programmer.</h3>



### About Me

Currently I spend most of my time working in cognitive science and psycholinguistics research. I find programming and cognitive science to be extremely complementary. Right now my research projects are focused on visual processing under conditions of uncertainty and image interference in visual processing. 

When I am not in the research lab you can find me:

- Reading large textbooks on a treadmill in the Rec Center. I love being active and this is how I balance physical activity and a demanding academic life. 
- Reading research. This is hardly a shock from a researcher, but I do make it a habit to find and read novel research regularly. I spend one weekend a month looking for new studies and then I read several a week for the rest of the month. It's a hobby that I enjoy and replaces reading the news or using social media, for me. 
- Programming small brain teasers, like leetcode, especially if it can be done recursively. I have a small collection of recursive programs and I like the challenge of converting a conventional algorithm to a recursive one. 

### Professional Areas of Interest

#### Process Improvements

If something's worth doing, it's worth doing right. As a lab manager I carry over the attention to detail from the experiment to the process. I love helping set up dashboards so that experiments are easier to track in real time. I also incorporate automating small tasks in my data tracking.  

#### PsychoPy

PsychoPy is an open source project for researchers, and I think this is the direction that cognitive research will be headed. In the future I plan to host small customizable solutions to common PsychoPy problems here on my GitHub. 

### Side Projects

#### PsychoPy Tutorials

I have a collection of classic psychological experiments created in the coder version of PsychoPy that I think make for good coding tutorials for new PsychoPy/Python users.

#### Games with in-built Statistical Models

Boy I bet I sound boring. Hear me out though, games are funner with a little side of statistics. My favorite creation is a game of war that updates your odds of winning with every round. It lets you know how badly you're doing.
